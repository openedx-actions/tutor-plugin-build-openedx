# tutor-plugin-build-openedx

Github Action that uses Tutor to build a Docker image for openedx, and uploads to an AWS Elastic Container Registry repository.

This action was originally created to work seamlessly with AWS EKS Kubernetes and ECR resources created by the Terraform modules contained in [Cookiecutter Tutor Open edX Production Devops Tools](https://github.com/lpm0073/cookiecutter-openedx-devops) but it should also work with your own custom workflows.

## About the openedx image

This is a production-ready image of the Open edX learning management system, substantially consisting of the repository [https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform).

## Usage

```yaml
name: Example workflow

on: workflow_dispatch

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # required antecedent
      - uses: actions/checkout

      # required antecedent
      - name: Configure AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.THE_NAME_OF_YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.THE_NAME_OF_YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-east-2

      # install and configure tutor and kubectl
      - name: Configure Github workflow environment
        uses: openedx-actions/tutor-k8s-init@v1

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome! Please note that this repository uses [semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) for automated processessing of commits and pull requests, and package publication for new releases. Please note the following about your commit message:

- pull requests can be approved and merged by any **two** authorized core committers
- only the 'next' branch can be merged to main. Thus, your Pull Request should be created from the 'next' branch
- we use [Angular commit message format](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-format). See below
- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- don't capitalize the first letter
- no dot (.) at the end

### Branches associated with CI automation

| Branch     | Description                                                                                           |
|:-----------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| main       | commits are prohibited. Only accepts automated merges via Github Actions                              |
| next       | this is the branch that I (Lawrence) primarly use for normal code maintenance                         |
| next-major | special use, in the unlikely event that we ever bump beyond version 1.x.x                             |
| beta       | if you're working on something large then merge here before doing anything in 'next'                  |
| alph       | if you're doing some really big then start here                                                       |

### About the Angular commit message format

An example:

```bash
  git commit -m "fix: fix bug in the yadda yadda step"
```

Your commit message should be prefixed with one of the following:

| Prefix   | Description                                                                                           |
|:---------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| build    | changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example - scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm) |
| ci       | changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (examples: Github Actions, CircleCi, SauceLabs)     |
| docs     | documentation only changes                                                                            |
| feat     | a new feature                                                                                         |
| fix      | a bug fix                                                                                             |
| perf     | a code change that improves performance                                                               |
| refactor | a code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature                                             |
| test     | adding missing tests or correcting existing tests                                                     |

More generally, less is more: don't use two words where one will suffice. Simple words are better than fancy words.
